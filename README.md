# AA Vector Math

## Introduction

A vector and matrix math library for 2D and 3D applications.

*Currently undergoing construction*

## Features

* 2D and 3D vectors  
* 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices

*TODO: document more features*


## Getting Started

Dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  vector_math:
    git: https://github.com/argentiapparatus/aa_vector_math.dart.git
```

*TODO: document Github releases*

Imports:

```dart
import 'package:aa_vector_math/vector_math.dart';
```

## Documentation

*TODO*

## Credits

This Dart library was inspired by and derived from John McCutchan's / Google's [vector_math.dart](https://github.com/google/vector_math.dart) library.

Vector, vector lists, matrix and quaternion classes were drawn directly from vector&#95;math.dart. Class APIs have been heavily reworked in an effort to adhere more closely to up-to-date Dart practices (see [Effective Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/effective-dart/)), and also as an excercise in API design for the author. Method implementations (i.e., the hard parts :)) are largely unchanged from those found in vector&#95;math.dart;
